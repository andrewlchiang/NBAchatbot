Ontologies are not dynamic 

POS/NER
NER and POS will be callable macros like ontologies. Using spacey which gives us access to tell us what named entity it recognizes. If there's something like #NER(person), it would match people's names. everything should be lowercase but NER won't work if it is all lowercase. We could just use NER which will recognize what category a word is, So if it say, I want to go to Atlanta, the NER would capture the locations
#POS will let us pass in stuff. We use them exactly as how we use the ontology macro.
